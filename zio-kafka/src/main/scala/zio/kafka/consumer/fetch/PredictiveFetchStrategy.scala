/**
 * A fetch strategy that predicts when a stream needs more data by analyzing its history.
 *
 * The prediction is based on the average number of polls the stream needed to process data in the recent past. In
 * addition, a stream can always fetch when it is out of data.
 *
 * This fetch strategy is suitable when processing takes at a least a few polls. It is especially suitable when
 * different streams (partitions) have different processing times, but each stream has consistent processing time.
 *
 * Note: this strategy has mutable state; a separate instance is needed for each consumer.
 *
 * @param maxEstimatedPollCountsToFetch
 *   The maximum number of estimated polls before the stream may fetch data. The default (and minimum) is 1 which means
 *   that data is fetched 1 poll before it is needed. Setting this higher trades higher memory usage for a lower chance
 *   a stream needs to wait for data.
